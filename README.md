TASK 3: CALCULATOR

🚀 Task 3 Completed!
 I'm excited to share my first project as part of the Web Development Internship at Codesoft — a fully functional calculator built using HTML, CSS (Flexbox), and JavaScript! 🧮💻
This calculator includes:
 ✔️ Responsive design using Flexbox
 ✔️ Functional buttons for all basic operations (+, –, ×, ÷, =, ., C)
 ✔️ Dynamic display and clean UI
🔹 This marks Task 3 of my internship journey, and I’m thrilled about the learning curve ahead. Many more exciting tasks are on the way — stay tuned! 😄
